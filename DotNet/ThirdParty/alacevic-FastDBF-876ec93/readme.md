Introduction
============

This is a fork of original [FastDBF project](https://fastdbf.codeplex.com) with some much-needed changes that I've made for my data import tools. It's not something major (yet), but the ability to change the encoding was [requested](https://fastdbf.codeplex.com/workitem/12248) for years now. So now you can have it too.


Changes
=======
 * configurable character encoding;
 * column indexer by column name;
 * no more dbf2csv sample app (it was convoluted and far from being helpful to learn the library anyway; just look at tests).

Copyrights and other such things
